= Empty Ruby Project

An empty Ruby project but with the bare essentials.

NOTE: This is a RubyGem project. This project may need to be renamed to clarify
this. Making an essential application project may come later, but for now, just
gems.

This is *my* empty Ruby (gem) project, so you will see some decisions like
my use of "Bacon":http://chneukirchen.org/darcs/darcsweb.cgi?r=bacon;a=summary
for writing my specs that you may not agree with. That's cool, but I use it.

You're welcome to either fork my project, change it in your instance, or just
try it out. The choice is completely yours.

Certainly, contribute back anything you find to be fantastically beneficial!
